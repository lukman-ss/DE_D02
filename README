To install packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file using `pip`, you can use the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you are in the same directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located. This command will read the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file and install them in the current virtual environment.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. Open your command prompt (Windows) or terminal (macOS/Linux).

2. Navigate to the directory where your `requirements.txt` file is located using the `cd` command:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   ```

3. Activate your virtual environment (if you haven't already):
   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On macOS and Linux:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

4. Install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file using the following command:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   This will install all the required packages specified in the `requirements.txt` file into your virtual environment.

Remember to replace `/path/to/your/project` with the actual path to your project directory where the `requirements.txt` file is located.
